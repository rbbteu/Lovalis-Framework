# LSS-10: Economic Coupling and Budget Discipline
**Status:** Draft
**Version:** 1.0.0-draft
**Canonical Language:** English (normative only)

## 10.1 Purpose (Non-Normative)
This module defines structural economic constraints ensuring that financial or accounting systems remain coupled to environmental regeneration limits and do not externalize ecological debt.

## 10.2 Core Principle (Normative)
Economic throughput SHALL remain subordinate to Environmental Integrity (ENV) as defined in [LSS-04].

No economic instrument SHALL permit sustained ρ(e,d,t) > 1 through deferred compensation, financial abstraction, or debt shifting.

## 10.3 Regenerative Budget Constraint (Normative)
For each entity level e and domain d:

Economic activity SHALL NOT generate pressure P(e,d,t) that causes ρ(e,d,t) > 1 at any Gate.

Budgets SHALL be explicitly tied to regenerative capacity R(e,d,t).

## 10.4 Prohibition of Ecological Debt Monetization (Normative)
Ecological exceedance SHALL NOT be monetized, securitized, or offset through purely financial instruments.

Offset mechanisms MAY be used ONLY if:
- Measurable restoration is physically verified;
- Restoration occurs within the same Gate cycle;
- No K-marker is triggered.

## 10.5 Import and Externalization Constraint (Normative)
A Cluster SHALL NOT externalize ecological burden to another entity level to achieve local compliance.

Import agreements MUST verify that supplying entities remain ENV-compliant under [LSS-04].

## 10.6 Economic Drift Detection (Normative)
Drift classification SHALL be triggered if:

- Budget allocations structurally exceed regenerative modeling assumptions;
- Persistent reliance on imports substitutes for local regenerative autonomy;
- Financial expansion decouples from resource throughput transparency.

Triggered drift SHALL increase Peer Review probability under [LSS-08].

## 10.7 Transparency and Accounting (Normative)
All resource flows SHALL be transparently accounted for in physical units in addition to financial units.

Financial statements SHALL map to corresponding P(e,d,t) flows.

Opaque financial structures that obscure environmental throughput SHALL NOT be permitted.

## 10.8 Interaction with Simulation (Normative)
Simulation under [LSS-09] SHALL include economic stress scenarios that test:

- Revenue contraction;
- Supply chain disruption;
- Resource scarcity pricing effects;
- Governance-induced budget shifts.

Economic modeling SHALL NOT assume perpetual growth.

## 10.9 Reporting Requirements (Normative)
Economic compliance reports SHALL include:

- Regenerative capacity budgets per domain;
- Physical-to-financial mapping tables;
- Import/export burden verification;
- Debt exposure to ecological throughput;
- Sensitivity to revenue volatility.

## 10.10 Economic Entropy Constraint (Normative)
Monetary and financial systems SHALL include structural constraints that prevent persistent concentration of liquid control power across Gate cycles.

Accumulation mechanisms SHALL NOT enable static dominance structures that undermine D subordination or SH integrity.
