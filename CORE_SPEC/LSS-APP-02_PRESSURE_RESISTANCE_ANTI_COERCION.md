# LSS-APP-02: Pressure Resistance & Anti-Coercion Layer

**Status:** Draft  
**Scope:** Normative  
**Subordination:** Subordinate to LSS-APP-01 and LSS-06.  
**Purpose:** Prevents the application from generating psychological pressure, identity-based evaluation, or coercive dynamics.

## 1. Principle

The application SHALL NOT generate:
- implicit performance pressure,
- identity-linked judgment,
- moral attribution,
- progress compulsion,
- psychological dependency.

Reflection is permitted. Pressure is prohibited.

## 2. Identity Decoupling

The application SHALL NOT make statements about:
- user character,
- competence,
- maturity,
- ""progress"" as a personal attribute.

Feedback MUST refer to:
- action + context + state,
not to the person.

Allowed:
> ""This decision may introduce tension under current conditions.""

Forbidden:
> ""You are acting unwisely.""

## 3. Anti-Optimization Safeguard

The application SHALL NOT:
- quantify development,
- measure ""improvement"",
- display streaks,
- rank behavior,
- present leaderboards or scoring as achievement.

Development remains qualitative.

## 4. No Repetition-Shaming

The application SHALL NOT state:
- ""You did this again.""
- ""You keep repeating mistakes.""
- ""This is your pattern.""

If similarity is referenced, it MUST be neutral:
> ""In similar situations, tension has often occurred.""

## 5. Soft-Stop Obligation

STOP/FRAGILE states SHALL be presented:
- with calm visuals,
- without alarmist language,
- without absolutist framing.

STOP means:
> ""Pause recommended.""
not:
> ""Abort required.""

## 6. Development Mode (Optional)

If the application offers ""development hints"":
- it MUST be explicit opt-in,
- it MUST be disable-able at any time,
- it MUST NOT auto-reactivate.

Default mode: reflective mode.

## 7. No Psychological Lock-In

The application SHALL NOT:
- create daily obligations,
- send push reminders without explicit consent,
- treat inactivity as failure,
- narratively frame ""return"" as a comeback.

Absence is neutral.

## 8. Self-Efficacy Protection

The application SHALL preserve the message:
> ""You decide, not the system.""

At least one of the following SHOULD exist:
- a clear ""Ignore"" option,
- a conscious ""Proceed anyway"" action,
- no blocking mechanism.

## 9. Anti-Surveillance Drift

If bio-resonance is integrated:
- physiological states SHALL NOT be moralized,
- high SH state SHALL NOT be framed as a deficiency,
- snooze SHALL be clearly visible,
- no cumulative body scoring for ""worthiness"" is permitted.

## 10. Non-Normative Note

The application aims to reduce unconscious reactivity, not to increase performance.
