# Deep DeepScan Report — DDS-01 (v8.8.4)

Scope: CORE_SPEC (LSS-00..12) + Compendium alignment (01_KERNEL, 02_VALITAS, 04_SIMULATION, 05_VERNETZUNG) + Reality/Physics/Malicious/Freedom checks.

## Summary
- Broken intra-LSS references: **0**
- Compendium docs scanned: **5**
- Critical contradictions found: **0**

## KRITISCH
- None.

## MAIN
- Exit baseline continuity package could be gamed if support is transferable/sellable outside Lovalis. Mitigation (implementation guidance): provide in-kind, non-transferable baseline where feasible; account as ENV budget; log DS-LOG.
- Transfer Zones need explicit anti-externalization measurement hooks (who bears ecological/social cost). Current wording is structurally correct but leaves measurement undefined; ensure LSS-04/05 indicators can be applied to transfer-zone flows.

## SUB
- Shadow Tribunal appears only in the Verfassung text; not surfaced in Kernel/Compendium summaries. Consider a brief mention in German Kernel overview to reduce interpretive blind spots.
- Re-entry 'demonstrated capability to comply' is correctly bounded by 'no ideology/lifestyle evaluation', but assessment criteria should be explicitly behavioral/understanding-based to avoid accidental 'belief-state' drift in implementation.
- Exit is non-punitive by principle; ensure 'no penalty' is interpreted as 'no stigma/no rights removal' while still allowing baseline support to end when the person opts out entirely (outside Lovalis). Communicate this transparently (already required in LSS-12 §12.8).

## WARN
- Compendium does not mention DeepScan explicitly (LSS-11). Risk: explanatory layer may drift from canonical CORE_SPEC over time.
- Compendium does not mention Transfer Zones / exit membrane concepts (LSS-12). Readers relying on German compendium may miss mobility boundaries.
- Full Lovalis (all modules) is not an 'overnight' implementation today; likely requires staged adoption. However, the CORE_SPEC is modular enough for pilots (e.g., DeepScan+ZVF gates, Node Zero, anti-cosmetic simulation).

## Reality Check (Today / 5–10y / 10–25y)
- **Today:** Pilots feasible (audit/spec layer, simulated gates, baseline services, transparent peer review). Full socio-economic conversion unlikely without crisis-driven coordination.
- **5–10 years:** Feasible for experimental communities/regions with strong infrastructure; measurement and governance tooling becomes tractable.
- **10–25 years:** Feasible as a standardized governance/audit protocol if ecological/energy constraints continue tightening and systems seek resilience standards.

## Physical Logic Check
- No statements implying free energy or violations of conservation detected.
- Key physical dependency is measurement of P/R (ρ) and regeneration rates; correctness depends on transparent methods and auditability (already required by ENV disclosure obligations).

## Malicious Exploitation Redteam Highlights
- **Exit-grant arbitrage:** mitigate with non-transferable, baseline-only provisioning and DS-LOG traceability.
- **Transfer-zone dumping:** enforce cost-internalization using ENV/SH/D indicators on imports/exports; avoid regulatory arbitrage (already normed).
- **Re-entry capture attempt:** keep re-entry evaluation bounded to Hard Invariants + compliance capability; prohibit ideology tests (already normed).
