# LSS-APP-04: Contextual Reflection Trigger (Descriptive Mode)

**Status:** Draft  
**Scope:** Normative  
**Subordination:** Subordinate to LSS-APP-02.  
**Purpose:** Enables occasional reflection invitations that remain descriptive (not interpretive), preserving transparency without generating pressure.

## 1. Goal

The application MAY name system dynamics.
It SHALL NOT interpret or judge them.

It describes movement, not meaning.

## 2. Language Rule

Only descriptive categories are permitted:
- intensity (""more intense moments"")
- frequency (""several moments"")
- movement (""high variance"")
- rhythm (""many quick decisions"")

Forbidden categories:
- emotional labels (""stressful"", ""good"", ""bad"")
- identity attribution
- performance evaluation
- causal claims

## 3. Trigger Text Matrix (Non-Exhaustive)

If STOP density is high:
> ""Today there were several high-tension moments.""

If decision cadence is high:
> ""Today contained many quick decisions.""

If SH is elevated:
> ""Today your system was tense in phases.""

If unusually calm:
> ""Today felt unusually quiet.""

If variance is high:
> ""Today there was a lot of movement in the system.""

## 4. Invitation Format

After the descriptive line, the application SHALL present only an invitation:
> ""Would you like to take a brief look?""

No recommendation. No instruction. No ""you should"".

## 5. Pressure Resistance Limits

Reflection invitations SHALL NOT:
- appear on two consecutive days,
- exceed 3 invitations per week,
- appear within 30 minutes after app start,
- reappear the same day after the user selects ""Not today"".

## 6. No Cross-Day Narratives

The application SHALL NOT reference:
- ""again"", ""as yesterday"", ""repeatedly"".

Each day stands alone.

## 7. Transparency Access (User-Initiated)

If the application is in reflective state, a user-initiated disclosure (e.g., long-press) SHALL be available, explaining categories used:
- decision cadence,
- tension moments (STOP/FRAGILE presence),
- SH change direction.

Disclosure SHALL NOT reveal counts or thresholds.

## 8. Non-Normative Note

Descriptive reflection aims to preserve relevance without converting reflection into obligation.
