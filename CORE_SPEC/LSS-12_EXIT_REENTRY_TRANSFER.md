# LSS-12: Exit, Re-Entry & Transfer Zones
**Status:** Draft
**Version:** 1.0.0-draft
**Canonical Language:** English (normative only)

## 12.1 Exit Principle (Normative)
Exit from Lovalis governance structures SHALL be permitted without punitive restriction.

No economic, legal, or social penalty SHALL be imposed solely due to voluntary exit.

## 12.2 Transitional Baseline Continuity (Normative)
A time-bounded baseline continuity package MAY be provided to exiting individuals, subject to ENV budget constraints.

Baseline continuity SHALL:
- be limited in duration;
- cover essential life-support resources only;
- NOT enable accumulation, capital leverage, or preferential advantage;
- be transparently accounted within regenerative capacity limits.

## 12.3 Re-Entry Principle (Normative)
Re-entry into Lovalis governance SHALL require explicit reaffirmation of Hard Invariants.

Re-entry evaluation SHALL assess:
- acceptance of Hard Invariants (required); and
- demonstrated capability to comply with Lovalis normative requirements.

Re-entry SHALL NOT evaluate personal ideology, lifestyle, personality traits, or cultural preferences beyond compliance with Hard Invariants and SH non-regression.

## 12.4 Compliance vs. Agreement (Normative)
Within Lovalis governance, compliance with normative requirements SHALL be mandatory regardless of personal agreement.

Individuals MAY disagree with non-invariant provisions while remaining compliant.

For re-entry, refusal to accept any Hard Invariant SHALL result in FAIL classification.

## 12.5 Structured Re-Integration (Normative)
Clusters MAY establish structured re-integration periods proportional to duration of absence.

Re-integration SHALL:
- prioritize psychological and social stabilization;
- ensure understanding of current governance structures and obligations;
- remain voluntary and terminable by the applicant at any time.

Re-integration SHALL be a protective process and SHALL NOT be punitive.

## 12.6 Dissent & Improvement Proposal Path (Normative)
Individuals who disagree with non-invariant provisions MAY submit an Improvement Proposal.

An Improvement Proposal SHALL:
- be evaluated under LSS-11 DeepScan; and
- include a Simulation impact preview under LSS-09 (175-year horizon) where structurally relevant.

Proposal evaluation outputs SHALL be documented and communicated in an accessible form.

Acceptance of a proposal SHALL NOT confer material rewards. Any procedural simplification (e.g., reduced re-integration duration) MAY occur ONLY if it is justified by reduced risk under LSS-11 and is applied consistently and non-discriminatorily.

## 12.7 Transfer Zones (Normative)
Transfer Zones are structured interaction domains between Lovalis Clusters and external systems.

Transfer Zone activities SHALL:
- remain subject to ENV regenerative constraints;
- comply with SH non-regression principles;
- prevent structural externalization of ecological or social costs;
- prohibit regulatory arbitrage via external jurisdiction to bypass Hard Invariants;
- avoid persistent dependency asymmetries between Clusters and external entities.

Transfer Zones SHALL NOT override Hard Invariants.

## 12.8 Transparency & Documentation (Normative)
Exit, re-entry, re-integration, and Transfer Zone operations SHALL be documented and auditable under LSS-11 DeepScan provisions.
